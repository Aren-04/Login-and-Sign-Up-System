## Login and Sign Up System

This project is a simple PHP user authentication system that includes signup, login, dashboard, and logout functionality. It uses MySQL to store user credentials securely with hashed passwords, and sessions to manage login state. The frontend is styled using custom CSS and all pages are centered for a clean UI. The project also includes an SQL file (user_auth.sql) to set up the database and table structure easily in phpMyAdmin.
